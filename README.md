# work4
This is project 4 assignment in Data Analyst Nanodegree from udacity.
This is the project of exploratory data analysis of white wines of Vinho Verde. The details of source of data can be find in reference. 

[main.html](https://github.com/AdenGuo/work4/blob/master/main.html) is the main html report file for the project. I suggest those who do not want to open this file in the browser. I recommand to use Google Chrome or Firefox for better performance. 

main.Rmd is the R markdown file creating above html. To run this file, please put original data file in the same position which is parallel to the directory which contains this rmarkdown file.  

reference is a text file containing link to resources that I used in this project.
