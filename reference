The most prestigious white grape of Vinho Verde is Alvarinho, better recognized by its Spanish name, Albariño, which is the one white wine from Spain everyone knows. Two other key grapes from the region are the Loureiro, the region's most-planted white grape, and Trajadura (Treixadura in Spanish). The Alvarinho is fairly high in acidity, while the Loureiro is wonderfully aromatic (it's said to smell like a laurel leaf) and the Trajadura contributes a pleasant citrus note.
The cheap, simple Vinho Verdes are usually blends of these grapes and others and frequently carry no vintage as they are blends of various years, and are made effervescent with added CO2. The more complex types are always vintage dated and mostly made from single-grape varieties.

so-called "green wine" of Portugal—either. Why not? The name is charming, but it can be a little confusing to consumers, since "green" merely alludes to the wine's young age and not its color. In fact, Vinho Verde—whether white, red, or rosé—is intended to be youthful and consumed soon after bottling.
